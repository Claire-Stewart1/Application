<p> I have read or have had read to me the participant information sheet
for this study and have asked all the questions I have at this time. I
understand that the study will involve observation of my visit with the
clinic nurse. I understand that the condition for which I am being seen
will be recorded, but no other information about me will be collected. </p>
